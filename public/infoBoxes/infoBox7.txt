The Occupy Movement was a series of peaceful protests where protestors occupied public spaces. The movement was inspired by protests around the world but is best known for the occupation of Wall Street. The occupations saw participation from many groups, especially students and young people who gathered to protest economic disparity, corporate greed and corruption in politics. The movement even attracted a sizable global following, showing how various age groups can participate in an important part of democracy, even if the movement was not tangibly successful.
