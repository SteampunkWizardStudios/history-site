Newspaper hawkers, also known as newsboys or newsies were workers, especially children, who distributed newspapers in city areas. They bought newspapers in bulk from a publisher and resold them while out on the streets. Newspaper hawkers were a crucial part of newspaper distribution in the mid 1800s to the early 1900s and became an iconic part of the American city. Since they were not legally considered employees, and were not subject to child labor laws, and several successful labor strikes occurred because of newspaper hawkers. The children and teens involved made a lasting impact on American cities and the fight against child labor.
