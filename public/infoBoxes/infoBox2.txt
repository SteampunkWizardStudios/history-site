The Flint Sit-down Strike was a sit-down strike at the General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan. After the great depression, General Motors required more out of workers while wages began to stagnate. The workers held a sit-in which lasted over a month during which it was winter. The sit-down strategy was highly effective, but in order for workers to continue it, the community had to supply them with food, water and other provisions like blankets. The task typically fell upon children and their families to give supplies to their family members in the plant. Children also participated in related rallies and marches during this time, as well as in their schools where they expressed their solidarity. The strike demonstrated how people of all ages could have an impact on the success.
