“The Dreamers” are young and undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The Dreamers have significantly changed the U.S’s immigration, specifically with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which provides temporary protection from deportation (deferred action). These young people, typically students or new professionals contribute greatly to American culture and identity. They also play a major role as advocates for immigration reform through rallying and lobbying. The Dreamers’ activism keeps immigration in the American zeitgeist and expands the opportunities that the U.S provides to more individuals.
