The Lowell Mill Girls were young female workers who labored in the textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, after the first industrial revolution. They tended to work long hours in difficult conditions but had an essential role in the economy of the United States and the textile industry. The Lowell Mill Girls were some of the first to participate in labor activism and organized the first strikes to advocate for better working conditions and shorter hours. The effort brought attention to labor issues in a new era of industrialization and became a base for future labor reforms. The group highlighted how young women were impacting the identity of the American worker.
