The Children’s March was a civil rights protest organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Thousands of African-American students participated in the march and faced violent responses from law enforcement. The protest successfully got their reaction out of the racist government officials in Birmingham. The young protesters’ bravery drew nation-wide attention to the Civil Rights Movement. As a result, Birmingham was desegregated and the Civil Rights Act was signed a year later, in part because of the Children’s March.
