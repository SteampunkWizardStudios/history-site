In March 1968, thousands of Chicano (American-born Mexican) students from several East Los Angeles high schools participated in a walkout in a coordinated protest against unequal education and opportunities for Chicano students. As part of the protest, the students demanded better facilities, more Chicano staff and a curriculum which included Mexican-American history and culture. The event gained significant media attention, especially due to the Civil Rights Movement, and led to the educational reform they were looking for. The activism of these students helped establish and promote cultural inclusion of Mexican-Americans while also affecting the school system in a tangible way.
