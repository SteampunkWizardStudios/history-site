The Free Speech Movement was a student-led protest that began in 1964 at the University of California, Berkeley. The university recently chose to ban on-campus political activities, restricting free speech. The movement quickly gained momentum and gained many involved student activists. Thousands of students participated in sit-ins and rallies where they demanded the right to free speech on the campus. At Sproul Hall, the administration building, over 1,000 students held a sit-in which even led to arrests. Ultimately, it was successful and university policy was changed to allow more political activities on campus. The movement sparked an interesting debate about when private organizations should uphold certain rights.
